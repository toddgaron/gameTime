# A simple game recommendation app.

A simple game recommendation engine using data scraped from BoardGameGeek. Given ratings for a few games or a username, it will return ten games rated by their similarity to your ratings.

Currently, the ratings have a bias towards wargames. This skewing will be removed in future iterations.

## Features to come:
- Removing the bias towards wargames
- Use a machine learning approach to figure out a user's true rating of a game
- Expand the number of games in the dataset
- Tune the algorithm to increase perceptivity

I would also like to build a database of board game manuals, and use a deep learning approach to generate new manuals for new games.
